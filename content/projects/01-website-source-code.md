This portfolio website is built using modern web technologies to be fast, responsive, and easily maintainable.

**Key Features:**
*   **Next.js App Router:** For server components and optimized builds.
*   **React & TypeScript:** For robust and type-safe component development.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first styling.
*   **Markdown Content:** Project details are managed in Markdown files.
*   **Static Export:** Optimized for deployment on platforms like Cloudflare Pages.
*   **Dynamic Homepage Screenshot:** The image for this project card (above) is a dynamically generated screenshot of the live homepage of this portfolio. It's fetched from a custom screenshot service (`screenshot.mithran.org`), showcasing a real-time view (cached, with potential delays for on-demand generation if not recently captured). This means the screenshot updates as the site updates!

The screenshot service uses Puppeteer to capture web pages. While it aims to provide an up-to-date view, there can be delays if a fresh screenshot isn't cached, especially for on-demand requests.
