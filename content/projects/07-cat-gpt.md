Meet CatGPT, an AI assistant with the purr-sonality of my cat, Molly!

This project involves:
*   **Roleplaying AI:** The chatbot is designed to interact with users as if it were Molly.
*   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** The AI leverages two knowledge sources:
    1.  The general internet for broad queries.
    2.  A curated knowledge base of documents describing Molly's life, habits, and quirks.
*   **Discord Integration:** The chatbot is accessible via a Discord server.

This allows for fun and engaging interactions, blending general AI capabilities with specific, personalized knowledge.
